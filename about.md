My name is Gavriel. I hope to use this website to share discoveries that I make on my own and with others.

One of my interests is using inductive programming to explore how humans and computers may communicate analytic ideas to and through each other, and to shift more of the burden of contextual understanding in communication from humans onto computers.

Wittgenstein's [Rule-Following Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittgenstein_on_Rules_and_Private_Language)'s lack of agreed-upon resolution and Quine's [Two Dogmas of Empiricism](http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html)'s dissolution of analyticity appear to set a hard theoretical limit on the subject for now. However, that doesn't preclude the possibility of seeing what we can practically or usefully achieve.

Dogs, maps, music, computers, and family are also pretty great.
